1. Class and Obj 
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why python is called OOP? - everything in python is an object (data structures, data types etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > you can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
