1. Class and Obj 
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why python is called OOP? - everything in python is an object (data structures, data types etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > you can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab


5. End to end Project (chatbook class)
    > function vs method  
    > magic method or dunder method
    > you can create attribute outside class as well
    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method
    
    
6. Inheritance
    > Why Inheritance
    > What gets inherited? - Constructor, Non private attributes and non private methods
    > Constructor overloading and method overloading
    > Super keyword(can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attributes, used only inside child class)
    > Types of Inheritance
        a. Single
        b. Multilevel
        c. Hierarchical
        d. Multiple(Diamond)
        e. Hybrid
